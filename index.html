        <h3>About Lorenzo</h3> <!-- header for "about me" section -->
        <p>I've always had an interest in technology. For the past veiw years I've been in the workforce, but I soon noticed that without a degree or specialized skills, I would be stuck working the same customer service type jobs that I did not enjoy. I decided that it was time for a change in my life so I dedicated my time to learning how to code! My other hobbies include PC gaming with friends, and watching Anime and Comedy (I love Impractical Jokers!)</p>
        <p>Instead of going back to school to finish my degree (I was previously persuing a B.A in History), I decided to enroll as a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> to further develop my programming and software engineering skills.</p>
        <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out! I'm exicted to put my skills to the test creating software!</p>
